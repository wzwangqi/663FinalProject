    "Spectral clustering is widely used in image segmentation. The main idea of spectral clustering is to use the spectrum (eigenvalues) of the similarity matrix of the data to perform dimensionality reduction and then perform clustering in fewer dimensions.  In this project, we investigated the normalized spectral decomposition algorithm from the paper \"On Spectral Clustering: Analysis and an algorithm\" by A. Ng, M. Jordan, and Y. Weiss [1]. Their algorithm improved upon the existing spectral clustering algorithm by resolving the issues of inconsistent algorithms of using eigenvectors as well as providing evidence for a reasonable clustering. We implemented the algorithm using Python with considering both idea and special cases. We also optimized the Python codes by applying vectorization, Cython, Just-In-Time compiling and parallelization. Finally, we tested the algorithm on simulated and real datasets and compare the experimental results with those of k-means clustering to see if spectral clustering dramatically improves the results."

    "## 1.  Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The research paper we chose is \"On Spectral Clustering: Analysis and an algorithm\" by A. Ng, M. Jordan, and Y. Weiss [1]. Spectral clustering is inspired by the the idea of spectral graph partitioning, in which we use the first two eigenvectors of a similarity matrix derived from the distance between points to partition the graph into exactly two parts. It is widely used in image segmentation. However, in previous literatures, authors are inconsistent in choosing and deriving eigenvectors. One of the achievement of A. Ng, M. Jordan, and Y. Weiss's paper is standardizing and simplifying the algorithem of spectral clustering[1]: utilising the  first $k$ largest eigenvectors to cluster points into  $k$ subsets. The detailed algorithm is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a set of $n$ points $S = \\{ s_1, \\ldots, s_n\\}$ in ${\\rm I\\!R}^{m}$, and we want to cluster them into $k$ groups.\n",
    "\n",
    " **Step 1:** Construct the affinity matrix $A \\in{\\rm I\\!R}^{n\\times n} $,  each element in A is defined as $A_{ij} = exp(-||s_i-s_j||^2/2\\sigma^2)$ and $A_{ii}=0$,  for $i, j = 1,\\ldots, n$. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2:** Define $D$ to be the diagonal matrix with $D_{ii} =\\sum_{j=1}^{n} A _{ij}$, and form the normalized Laplacian matrix $L = D^{-1/2}AD^{-1/2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3:** Capture the fist $k$ largest eigenvectors of $L, x_1, x_2,  \\ldots, x_k, x_i \\in {\\rm I\\!R}^{n} $ and form the matrix $X = [x_1 ~x_2 ~\\cdots ~x_k ] \\in  {\\rm I\\!R}^{n\\times k}.$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4:** Create the new normalized matrix $Y \\in {\\rm I\\!R}^{n\\times k}$ from $X$, defined as $Y_{ij}= X_{ij}/(\\sum_{j=1}^{n}X_{ij}^2)^{1/2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Step 5:** Consider $Y$ to be a set of $n$   points that need to be clustered now, apply K-means or any other algorithm that can minimize distortion to cluster $Y$. \n",
    "\n",
    "** Step 6:**  Assign the original point $s_i$ in to cluster $j$ if and only if the $i$th-row of $Y$ was distributed to cluster $j$  in previous step.       \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing to the straighforward K-means clustering, this algorithm improves the performance by normalizing affinity matrix $A$ and $X$. Especially for dataset in two-dimensional that are not correpsonding to convex region (like circular graph and moon-like graph), spectral clustering results in more reasonable clustering than K-means. We will implement this experiment in later parts.  This report is organized as follows: In part 2, we implement the spectral clustering algorithm on both idea and special cases. Next, we practice the unit test and optimize coding in part 3 and 4, respectively.  Part 5 applies the algorithm in real and simulated datasets and compare the results with k-means clustering. Part 6 draws some conclusions.\n",

    "## 2. Implementation\n",
    "We write four functions to implement the algorithm. The first two functions, `GenerateData` and `CreateCircle`, simluate data in idea case and special case, respectively. In the third function `CalculateAffinity`, we calculate the affinity matrix which is exactly the first step in the above described algorithm. The last function `Spectral` is the core function, which implements Step 2 to 6 in the algorithm and returns the labels for assigning each point into cluster.\n",

    "### 2.1 Simulate Data\n",
    "We create two functions to simulate dataset. The ideal case denotes the situation when the clusters are clearly partitioned and are far apart from each other. Our first function `GenerateData` generates data that falls under this category. \n",
    "\n",
    "In function `CreateCircle`, we generage data in two dimensions that not conrresponds to convex region. To be specific, we .......\n",
    "\n",
    "We choose to show the JIT compiling code below, since this is the fastest code after optimizing. We will provide detail about the comparison among different optimization method in part 4. "
